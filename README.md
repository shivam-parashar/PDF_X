# PDF_X
Project Name: Data Extraction From Patent Files:
Domain: Data extraction.
Description:
Developed data extraction software in python that extracts raw data from pdf files and builds a MySQL database and creates CSV files.
Implemented various algorithms to increase the accuracy of extraction up to 90%.

Steps Involved:
  The project involves tons of PDF patent files with some particular format.
  The the user asks for required data while interacting with the front-end of the web page.
  Then, the data extraction methods in the backend run for those queries and applied various algorithms in Python. 
  Later storing that output data in database.
  Finally the extracted data appears in a presentable form in the web page and you can view/download the data that you had asked for.
